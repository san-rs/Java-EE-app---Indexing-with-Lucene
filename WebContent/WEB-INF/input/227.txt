Java Programming/Keywords/import From Wikibooks, open books for an open world < Java Programmingâ€Ž | Keywords Jump to: navigation, search import is a Java keyword. It declares a Java class to use in the code below the import statement. Once a Java class is declared, then the class name can be used in the code without specifying the package the class belongs to. Use the '*' character to declare all the classes belonging to the package. Syntax: import package.JavaClass; import package.*; The static import construct allows unqualified access to static members without inheriting from the type containing the static members: import static java.lang.Math.PI; Once the static members have been imported, they may be used without qualification: double r = cos(PI * theta); Caveat: use static import very sparingly to avoid polluting the program's namespace!
