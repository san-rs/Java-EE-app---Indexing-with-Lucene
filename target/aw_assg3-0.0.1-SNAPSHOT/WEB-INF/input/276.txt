Java Programming/Keywords/instanceof From Wikibooks, open books for an open world < Java Programmingâ€Ž | Keywords Jump to: navigation, search instanceof is a keyword. It checks if an object reference is an instance of a type, and returns a boolean value; The <object-reference> instanceof Object will return true for all non-null object references, since all Java objects are inherited from Object. instanceof will always return false if <object-reference> is null. Syntax: <object-reference> instanceof TypeName For example: class Fruit { //... } class Apple extends Fruit { //... } class Orange extends Fruit { //... } public class Test { public static void main(String[] args) { Collection<Object> coll = new ArrayList<Object>(); Apple app1 = new Apple(); Apple app2 = new Apple(); coll.add(app1); coll.add(app2); Orange or1 = new Orange(); Orange or2 = new Orange(); coll.add(or1); coll.add(or2); printColl(coll); } private static String printColl( Collection<?> coll ) { for (Object obj : coll) { if ( obj instanceof Object ) { System.out.print("It is a Java Object and"); } if ( obj instanceof Fruit ) { System.out.print("It is a Fruit and"); } if ( obj instanceof Apple ) { System.out.println("it is an Apple"); } if ( obj instanceof Orange ) { System.out.println("it is an Orange"); } } } } Run the program: java Test The output: "It is a Java Object and It is a Fruit and it is an Apple" "It is a Java Object and It is a Fruit and it is an Apple" "It is a Java Object and It is a Fruit and it is an Orange" "It is a Java Object and It is a Fruit and it is an Orange" Note that the instanceof operator can also be applied to interfaces. For example, if the example above was enhanced with the interface interface Edible { //... } and the classes modified such that they implemented this interface class Orange extends Fruit implements Edible { ... } we could ask if our object were edible. if ( obj instanceof Edible ) { System.out.println("it is edible"); } Retrieved from "https://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Java_Programming/Keywords/instanceof&oldid=3241564" Category: Book:Java Programming/KeywordsHidden category: Pages with deep filing
