Java Programming/Keywords/private From Wikibooks, open books for an open world < Java Programmingâ€Ž | Keywords Jump to: navigation, search private is a Java keyword which declares a member's access as private. That is, the member is only visible within the class, not from any other class (including subclasses). The visibility of private members extends to nested classes. Please note: Because access modifiers are not handled at instance level but at class level, private members of an object are visible from other instances of the same class!
