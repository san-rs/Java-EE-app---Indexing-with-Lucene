If you have not already installed Eclipse, read this page. If you have not already installed an application server, read this page. Launch Eclipse On the Project Explorer view, right-click and select New -> Other... Select Web -> Dynamic Web project . Type helloworld for the Project name. On Target runtime, make sure that you have selected your application server instance. Click on Finish . Double-click on your new project to open it. Right-click on the folder WebContent . Select New -> JSP File . On File name, type FirstPage.jsp. It will be the name of your JSP. Click on Finish . The new FirstPage.jsp file should appear in the folder WebContent . Locate the text <body> in the new JSP file. After this text, write Hello World!. Right-click on the folder WebContent/WEB-INF . Select New -> File . On File name, type web.xml. This file is used to link our JSP with a URL in order to access to it. It can map many other things. Click on Finish . Double-click on the new file to open it. In the file, write the following content: <?xml version="1.0" encoding="ISO-8859-1" ?> <web-app xmlns="http://java.sun.com/xml/ns/j2ee" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://java.sun.com/xml/ns/j2ee http://java.sun.com/xml/ns/j2ee/web-app_2_4.xsd" version="2.4"> <servlet> <servlet-name>firstpage</servlet-name> <jsp-file>/FirstPage.jsp</jsp-file> </servlet> <servlet-mapping> <servlet-name>firstpage</servlet-name> <url-pattern>/firstpage</url-pattern> </servlet-mapping> </web-app> Right-click on the project. Select Export -> WAR file . If you don't find the option WAR file, click on Export... instead, select Web -> WAR file and click on Next >. The web project should be named helloworld . Choose a location for the destination. It's the folder where your application containing your JSP will be created. Remember this location. Click on Finish . Go on the folder where you have created your application. You should see a file named helloworld.war . Copy/paste your WAR file in the deployment folder of your application server. Start your application server. On a browser, go on http://localhost:8080/helloworld/firstpage. You should see "Hello World!". On the URL, helloworld comes from the name of the WAR file we have created and firstpage comes from the markup <url-pattern> in the web.xml file. To do: Explain how to build a WAR without an IDE.
