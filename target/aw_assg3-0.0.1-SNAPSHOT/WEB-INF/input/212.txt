Java Programming/Keywords/char From Wikibooks, open books for an open world < Java Programmingâ€Ž | Keywords Jump to: navigation, search char is a keyword. It defines a character primitive type. char can be created from character literals and numeric representation. Character literals consist of a single quote character (') (ASCII 39, hex 0x27), a single character, and a close quote ('), such as 'w'. Instead of a character, you can also use unicode escape sequences, but there must be exactly one. Syntax: char variable name1 = 'character1'; Code section 1: Three examples. 1 char oneChar1 = 'A'; 2 char oneChar2 = 65; 3 char oneChar3 = '\u0041'; 4 System.out.println(oneChar1); 5 System.out.println(oneChar2); 6 System.out.println(oneChar3); Output for Code section 1 A A A 65 is the numeric representation of character 'A' , or its ASCII code. The nominal wrapper class is the java.lang.Character class when you need to store a char value but an object reference is required. Code section 2: char wrapping. 1 char aCharPrimitiveType = 'A'; 2 Character aCharacterObject = aCharPrimitiveType; See also: Java Programming/Primitive Types Retrieved from "https://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Java_Programming/Keywords/char&oldid=3241545" Category: Book:Java Programming/KeywordsHidden category: Pages with deep filing
